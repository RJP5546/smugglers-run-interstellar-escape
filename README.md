<h1>Smugglers Run: Interstellar Escape</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Smugglers Run: Interstellar Escape, is an Alternate Control Game that wants part of the gameplay to be in the controls themselves. Use a custom made controller to pilot your ship and immerse your body into this intergalactic adventure! Pilot your ship using the floor pedals to move horizontally, and a crank wheel to go up or down. For players without the custom controller use the A and D keys to move horizontally and your mouse wheel to move up and down.
